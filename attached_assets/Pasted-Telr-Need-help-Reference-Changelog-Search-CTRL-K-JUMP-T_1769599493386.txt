Retry guidelines for VISA cards in recurring transactions
Transactions with response codes 11, 66, 67, 91, 109, 110, 112, and 113 must not be retried. VISA may impose a fee for each retry attempt following the first decline.

All other response codes can be retried up to 15 times within 30 days after the first decline.


Retry guidelines for Mastercard cards in recurring transactions
Transactions with response codes 11, 12, 66, 91, and 110 must not be retried, as Mastercard may consider such attempts non-compliant and could impose fines.


Response code 01 (Invalid Request)
This data is not used as part of the transaction processing, but a record of the data is kept with the transaction. This can be of use should a customer dispute a transaction, providing additional details of where the device was when the transaction was processed.

There are many possible causes of the ‘Invalid Request’ response. In order to help maintain system security the exact cause is not contained with the response. For example the reason could be that the request has been received from an un-authorised IP address, or that the password used is not correct. This information is not divulged as part of the response data, you will need to view the exception report to see the full details.

A common cause of this error is attempting to use the mobile API without first requesting that it is added to your account. You must first request that the mobile API is added to your account before you start to use it – this is not enabled by default. As part of the activation process you will be supplied with the authentication key.

The results will show the order status, and if applicable the transaction status. Order status codes are as follows:

Order Status	Description
1	Pending
2	Authorised (Transaction not captured, such as an AUTH transaction or a SALE transaction, which has been placed on hold)
3	Paid (Transaction captured, SALE transaction, not placed on hold)
4	Payment Requested
-1	Expired
-2	Cancelled
-3	Declined
-4	Replaced
