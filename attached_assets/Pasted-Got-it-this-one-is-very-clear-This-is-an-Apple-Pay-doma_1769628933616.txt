Got it — this one is very clear 👍
This is an Apple Pay domain validation error, not a card or app bug.

What the error actually means

“merchantId … not registered for domain = thesamanapp.com”

Apple is saying:
➡️ Your Apple Pay Merchant ID is NOT authorized to be used on thesamanapp.com

So when your app tries to create an Apple Pay session, Apple rejects it at validation step.

Why this happens (common causes)

One (or more) of these is missing or wrong:

Domain not added in Apple Developer

Your Merchant ID exists

But thesamanapp.com is not registered under it

Apple Pay verification file missing or wrong

File not uploaded

Wrong path

HTTPS issue

Wrong content

Mismatch between backend + Apple Merchant ID

Backend uses one Merchant ID

Apple Developer dashboard has another

Exact fix (step-by-step, do this carefully)
1️⃣ Go to Apple Developer

https://developer.apple.com

Certificates, IDs & Profiles

Merchant IDs

Select:

merchant.com.YOURNAME (the one used by Telr)

2️⃣ Add your domain

Click Apple Pay

Under Merchant Domains

Add:

thesamanapp.com


⚠️ Must be exact, no www unless your backend uses it

3️⃣ Upload the Apple verification file

Apple gives you a file named:

apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association


Upload it exactly here:

https://thesamanapp.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association


✅ No extension
✅ No redirect
✅ HTTPS required
✅ Publicly accessible

Test it in browser — it must download or show raw text.

4️⃣ If you’re using Telr (important)

Since you mentioned Telr before:

Telr must be configured with the same Merchant ID

Telr backend calls Apple on your behalf

If Telr has a different merchantId → validation fails

👉 Ask Telr support to re-confirm Apple Pay merchant + domain

Why card payments work but Apple Pay fails

Because:

Cards = Telr only

Apple Pay = Apple + Telr + your domain

Apple is stricter.

Quick checklist ✅

 Merchant ID correct

 Domain added in Apple Developer

 .well-known file accessible

 HTTPS valid

 Telr using same Merchant ID

If you want, tell me:

Are you using web Apple Pay, in-app (iOS), or both?

Is Telr handling Apple Pay server-side?

I’ll pinpoint exactly which step is failing so you don’t go back and forth with Telr or Apple.
