"Hi Rahul,
I tested Apple Pay and received 'Authentication key mismatch' (Exception ID: 3393812).
As you can see in the exception log, the Apple Pay token is complete:
paymentData/version: EC_v1
paymentData/data: 428 characters
paymentData/signature: 2948 characters
All header fields present
paymentMethod: Visa 3705
This means Apple successfully encrypted the payment. The 'Authentication key mismatch' error means Telr's system cannot decrypt it.
Please verify that both certificate files are correctly configured for Store ID 32400:
Certificate: https://thesamanapp.com/download/certPem.pem
Private Key: https://thesamanapp.com/download/privatePem.pem
These files match (I verified the public key hash). The issue is in how they're configured on your system.
Thank you"

Dear Saeed,
Thank you for sharing the applepay certificate; it seems fine, and we have uploaded the same for your Store ID: 32400. Please note that since we enabled the Apple certificate setup hence the Applepay option from Telr hosted payment page has been disabled now.

Dear Saeed,
We need the key and the payment processing certificate in ".PEM" format, as indicated in the image below.

 
The provided certificate and key file must be in a readable format, like below.

 
Kindly convert them and share.

Hi Telr Support,
Please update my Apple Pay certificate for Store ID 32400.
I'm attaching the new certificate files:
apple_pay_new.cer (certificate)
apple_pay_key.p12 (private key, password: saman123)
These are for Merchant ID: merchant.saeed.saman
After updating, please confirm so I can test the Apple Pay integration.
Thank you,
Saeed Hokal
Store ID: 32400
​​​apple_pay_new.cer​

PS One is uploaded to one drive because .cer cannot be attIchment while key .p12 is attached
my issue is native apple pay keeps failing on the new app i am making but it worked previously on the AWS one.
